## Migrating from `< 3.0.0`

If you are migrating from a version older than `3.0.0`, be sure to update your import as we migrated to ES6 named imports.

If your environment supports the ES6 module syntax, you can `import` as described above:

```ts
import { Feed } from "feed";
```

Otherwise, you can stick with `require()`:

```diff
- const Feed = require('feed');
+ const Feed = require('feed').Feed;
```
